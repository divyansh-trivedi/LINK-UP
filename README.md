# Link-Up
Link Up is a social media website which enables you to interact with your friends in a temporary room. You can share photos, videos, audios and chat with your friends and the best part is that nothing will be stored, not even your username so you can create room or join room with new username everytime when you will visit this site. There are no annoying authentications since nothing is getting stored and your privacy will also be secured.
